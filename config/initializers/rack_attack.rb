  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.ip}"
  throttle('req/ip', limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    # prevent static assets from counting towards the rate limit
    req.ip unless req.path.start_with?('/assets') || req.path.start_with?("/packs")
